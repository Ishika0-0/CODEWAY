        <h1>Introducing <br></h1>
        <br><span>' Ferrari SF-24 '<br></span><br>
            <p>The SF-24 is the third car of the new Formula 1 ground effect generation, but it breaks with the tradition ofthe past two years, starting with the look of it. The design group, led by Enrico Cardile, aimed to give Charles and Carlos a car that is easy to drive and that reacts predictably, with as a starting point, the positive feeling the drivers had in the cockpit over the final few races of last   season. The goal is to allow them to make the most of the power unit’s potential, combined with their undoubted skill behind the wheel.the car is aesthetically very different to its predecessors and this also goes for the livery.</p>

                <h3> Driver #16</h3>
                <p>I like the look of the car a lot, including the white and yellow parts on the bodywork. But of
                    course, what really interests me is how it will perform on track, as that’s all that matters. The
                    SF-24 ought to be less sensitive and easier to drive and for us drivers that’s what you need in
                    order to do well.</p>

                <h3>Driver #55</h3>
                <p>When I saw the SF-24 for the first time, I couldn’t wait to jump in and fire it up. Now, I’m looking
                    forward to driving it on track to see if it correlates with the feeling I had from the simulator,
                    which is that it’s the step forward we all want. The aim is to have a car that’s more driveable and
                    therefore able to run at a consistent race pace.</p>

                <h3>Team Principal</h3>
                <p>Presenting a new car to the world for the first time is always a very exciting moment for me and the
                    drivers, even if we are all already thinking about the moment we will go head to head with our
                    rivals on track. when we were consistent front runners, with a view to constantly improving in all
                    areas.</p>
